Write the my_swap function, which receives three variables of the int& type and a string consisting of three digits: 1, 2 and 3, standing in any order. The function should change the contents of these variables in places according to the string and return 0.
If the string "231" is passed, then the first variable should contain the value of the second variable, the second variable should contain the value of the thirds, and the third variable should contain the value of the first.
The code sent must contain nothing but the corresponding function.
