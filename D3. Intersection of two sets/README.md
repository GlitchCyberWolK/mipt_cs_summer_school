Two unordered arrays of integers are given. We will consider them as sets with repeating elements.
Without using additional memory, it is required to print the intersection of the two sets.
So, arrays (2, 1, 2, 3) and (2, 4, 2, 2) have an intersection (2, 2).
At the end of the program, the arrays themselves should be the same as they were after filling.

## **Input format**

You are first supplied a value n ≤ 100 - the number of elements in the first array. The next line of input contains the elements of the first array.
Then the input given is a value m ≤ 100 - the number of elements in the second array. The next line of the input contains the elements of the second array. The elements in both arrays are integers not exceeding 10,000 in absolute value.

## **Output format**

List the common data elements of the arrays in the order in which they appear in the first array.


| Example    | Output        |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
|  5 2 1 2 3 4 4 2 4 2 2| 2 2 4|
| 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 5 2 4 6 8 10| 2 4 6 8 10 |
