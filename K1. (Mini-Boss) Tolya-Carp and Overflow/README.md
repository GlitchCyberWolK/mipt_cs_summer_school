Once Tolya-Karp passed through the local market. And a strange picture opened up to his gaze, a crowd of onlookers watched something in surprise.
Squeezing into the midst of the crowd, Tolya-Karp, without expecting it, came across a stool. A suspicious stranger on the other hand invited him to sit on it and play an interesting game with him. Tolya-Karp with all his gills sensed something was wrong and sent you a telepathic message for help.
The rules of the game are as follows: given two integers a and b. You need to find an integer c that will have the same deviation from a and b. It looks simple. Help Tolya-Karp find c, otherwise he will remain sitting on that stool.

## **Input format**


The only line contains two integers a and b (-263 + 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 263 - 1).

## **Output format**

Find the integer c. If there is no such number, print one single line "Run away, Tolya-Karp" without brackets.


| Example    | Output        |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
|  8 18  | 13 |
| 0 1 | Run away, Tolya-Karp |
