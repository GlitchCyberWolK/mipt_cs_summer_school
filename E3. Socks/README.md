There is a table of length L. N socks are laid out on the table so that no sock crawls out of the table. Then there is the smart boy Vaska, who wants to measure the length of the table covered with socks at M points.

## **Input format**

In the input file, first L, N, M are given (1 ≤ L ≤ 10000, 1 ≤ N ≤ 10000, 1 ≤ M ≤ 100000).
Then there are N pairs of numbers l ≤ r from 1 to L - the left and right ends of the socks.
Then there are M numbers from 1 to L points of interest to Vaska.
All numbers are integers.

## **Output format**

Print M numbers - the length of the sock covering the table at each given points.
