Tolya-Karp, as it happens every day, checked his mailyusk mail. And, for the first time in 2 weeks, he received an anonymous letter, the content of which shocked our hero.
Someone incognito claimed that he was aware of what powers Tolya-Karp possessed. But how is that !? After all, Tolya-Karp did not tell anyone (except you) about them.
There were no more options, it was necessary to calculate the sender using detective methods. One of them: count the number of spaces in the message in order to understand which fish has revealed his secrets. But the message is very large, and Tolya-Karp cannot write parsing scripts. Can you help him?
