The fundamental theorem of arithmetic was proved by Gauss in his Disquisitiones Arithmeticae. It states that every composite number can be expressed as a product of prime numbers and that, save for the order in which the factors are written, this representation is unique.

You need to decompose the integer N into prime factors and output the result in ascending order.

## **Input format**

The program is given a number (2 <= N <= 10^9).

## **Output format**

Print the decomposition of N into prime factors.


| Example    | Output        |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| 2 | 2 | 
| 1008 | 2^4*3^2*7 |
