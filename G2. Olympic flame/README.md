In one well-known city, the Winter Olympic Games will start soon. In this regard, the organizers of the Games decided to hold the Olympic torch relay - the longest and largest in the history of the Olympic Games. The relay consists of N stages, each ai kilometers long (1 ≤ i ≤ N). The organizers have a large number of Olympic torches, each of which can continuously burn for K kilometers of the race. According to the rules of the relay, each torch is used only once. At the beginning of each stage, the relay participants are given a certain number of torches, so that the Olympic flame can be carried to the end of the stage. At the end of the stage, all used (fully or partially) torches are donated to their torchbearers.
Write a program that, according to the well-known scheme of the Olympic torch relay, determines the required total number of torches for the relay.

## **Input format**

The first line contains two natural numbers N and K (N ≤ 100, K ≤ 106).
The second line contains N natural numbers a_i (a_i ≤ 106).

## **Output format**

On the first line print one natural number F - the number of torches that the organizers will need to hold the Olympic torch relay.
