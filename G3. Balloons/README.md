In a computer game, the player places balls of different colors in a line. When a continuous chain of three or more balls of an identical color is formed, it is removed from the line. All the balls are shifted to each other at the same time, and the situation may repeat itself.
Write a program that determines how many balls will be "destroyed" according to this situation. Certainly, there can be no more than one continuous chain of three or more one-color balls at the initial moment.

## **Input format**

First, enter the number of balls in the chain (no more than 1000) and the colors of the balls (from 0 to 9, each color corresponds to its own integer).

## **Output format**

It is required to output the number of balls that will be "destroyed".

| Example    | Output        |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
|  5 1 3 3 3 2 | 3 |
| 10 3 3 2 1 1 1 2 2 3 3| 10 |
| 3 0 0 0 | 3 |
