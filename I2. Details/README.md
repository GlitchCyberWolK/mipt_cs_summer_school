There are N kg of metal alloy. Workpieces weighing K kg each are made from it. After that, parts with a mass of M kg each are turned from each workpiece (the maximum possible number of parts is milled from each workpiece). If after that something remains from the workpieces, then this material is returned to the beginning of the production cycle and fused with what was left in the manufacture of workpieces. If the alloy that has turned out is sufficient for the manufacture of at least one workpiece, then workpieces are again made from it, parts from them, etc.
Write a program that will calculate how many parts can be obtained using this technology from the initially available N kg of alloy.

## **Input format**

Enter N, K, M. All numbers are natural and do not exceed 200.

## **Output format**

Print one number - the number of parts that can be obtained using this technology.

|  10 5 2 | 4 |
| 13 5 3 | 3 |
