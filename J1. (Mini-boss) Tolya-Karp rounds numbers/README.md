Tolya-Karp heard that somewhere on the outskirts of his lake there were two real numbers a and b.
And, worst of all, a was divided by b, after which the resulting number was rounded up to 3 decimal places. That's not all, there are always 3 decimal places in the resulting number, even if they are insignificant zeros.
Now Tolya-Karp is haunted by one question, what is the resulting number? Help him regain his calmness.

## **Input format**


The only line contains two real numbers with no more than 3 decimal places (-1e3 ≤ a, b ≤ 1e3).

## **Output format**

Give an answer to the question posed, print the resulting number with 3 decimal places (as well as rounded to 3 decimal places).

| Example    | Output        |
