You are given a permutation of the first N natural numbers. Find the next one in lexicographic order (we assume that the permutation N N-1 ... 3 2 1 is followed by an identical permutation, that is, 1 2 3 ... N).

## **Input format**

The first line of the input data contains the number N (1 <= N <= 10000). The second line contains a permutation (a sequence of natural numbers from 1 to N, separated by spaces).

## **Output format**

It is required to output the desired permutation.
