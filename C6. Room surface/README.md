It is necessary to calculate the area of the room in a square maze.

## **Input format**

In the first line, the number N is entered — it is the size of the maze (3 ≤ N ≤ 10). The next N lines contain a maze ( ' . 'is an empty cell,' * ' is a wall). And finally, the last row contains two numbers – the number of the row and column of the cell located in the room whose area needs to be calculated. It is guaranteed that this cell is empty and that the maze is surrounded by walls on all sides.

## **Output format**

You need to print a single number – the number of empty cells in this room.
