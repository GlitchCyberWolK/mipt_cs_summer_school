In connection with the visit of Emperor Palpatine, it was decided to renew the composition of droids in hangar 32. Due to the crisis, it was decided not to buy new droids, but to throw out a couple of old ones. As you know, Palpatine does not tolerate droids with small serial numbers, so all that is required is to find among them the two with the lowest serial numbers.

## **Input format**

The first line of the input file contains an integer N - the number of droids. (2 ≤ N ≤ 1000), second line - N integers, not exceeding 2 * 10^9 - droid numbers

## **Output format**

Print two numbers: the first is the least largest of the droid numbers (this should be disposed of first), and the second is the second smallest .
