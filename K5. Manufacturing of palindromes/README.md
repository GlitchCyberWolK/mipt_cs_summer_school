A string consisting of lowercase Latin letters was brought to the repair shop. The customer wants to make a palindrome out of it. In the workshop, they can replace an arbitrary letter in a line with any letter chosen by the customer for 1 dollar.
What is the minimum amount the customer will have to pay for the repair of the line?
Recall that a palindrome is a string that is equal to itself, read in the opposite direction.

## **Input format**

The input data contains a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, which was brought by the customer. The string length does not exceed 10^4.

## **Output format**

Print a single integer — the minimum amount that the customer will have to pay for turning the string brought by the customer into a palindrome.


| Example    | Output        |
